            You know that smartphone app you rely on? That computer game that
            kept you transfixed for hours as a kid? That program that helps you
            budget and track expenditures? Software developers created all of
            them. Software developers are the creative, brainstorming
            masterminds behind computer programs of all sorts. While some
            software developers may focus on a specific program or app, others
            create giant networks or underlying systems that help trigger and
            power other programs. This is why there are two main classifications
            of developers: applications software developers and systems software
            developers.

        <h2>Intro</h2>
        <p>
          Hello! I'm Carlo Castro currently studying Bachelor of Science in
          Information technology at the University of the Immaculate Conception.
          Being a 2nd year in my department we need to create a Personal
          Portfolio about our future careers and the path we want to persue in
          computer studies.

          As technology advances, so does the demand for software developers and
          programmers with up-to-date abilities. CTOs, as well as other
          management jobs such as AI architects, are open to experienced
          engineers and talented programmers with good interpersonal abilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          An organization's online and mobile apps are developed by a software
          developer. The ability to develop complicated codes, database
          expertise, and programming are all required skills in this field.
          People who work as software developers for a long time eventually rise
          up the ranks to positions such as CTO or lead developer.
