            You know that smartphone app you rely on? That computer game that
            kept you transfixed for hours as a kid? That program that helps you
            budget and track expenditures? Software developers created all of
            them. Software developers are the creative, brainstorming
            masterminds behind computer programs of all sorts. While some
            software developers may focus on a specific program or app, others
            create giant networks or underlying systems that help trigger and
            power other programs. This is why there are two main classifications
            of developers: applications software developers and systems software
            developers.
