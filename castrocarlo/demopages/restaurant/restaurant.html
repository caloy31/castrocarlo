            <p>One day in 1958, two enterprising college students, Frank and Dan Carney, borrowed $600 from their mom and opened a small pizza restaurant in their hometown in Wichita, Kansas.

Frank and Dan Carney's secret of success was using only the freshest meat and vegetable toppings, with each pizza baked fresh to order. By December of the same year, they opened their second restaurant. By 1968, just 10 years later, they had opened over 300 restaurants.

Today, Pizza Hut serves over a million pizzas a day in more than 15,600 restaurants in 90 countries making it the No.1 pizza brand in the world.

In the Philippines, Pizza Hut began in 1984. It is now the country's most popular pizza chain serving Metro Manila and surrounding provinces, as well as Visayas and Mindanao with its Dine-In Restaurants, Delivery Units and Express Counters.

The Home of Pan Pizza has indeed come a long way. It is still delighting millions of customers with pizza that is like no other - no wonder it's the world's favorite. So why don't you take home to your loved ones one of our world-famous pizzas today?</p>
