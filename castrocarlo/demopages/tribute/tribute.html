        is an Australian singer, based in South Korea. She is a member of
        Blackpink. Born as Roseanne Park in Auckland, New Zealand, she was given
        the Korean name of Park Chae-young and grew up in Melbourne, Australia.
        As a child, Rosé already had a passion for singing. She was a part of
        their church's choir in Australia. When she found out that YG
        Entertainment were holding their auditions in Sydney, Australia back in
        2012, she quickly went there coming all the way from Melbourne to
        audition. Rose ranked first in the auditions, and she became a part of
        YG Entertainment on the same day. After training for four years, YG
        finally put her as the main vocalist and lead dancer of Blackpink. She
        was the last member to be revealed in the band. She attended Canterbury
        Girls' Secondary College in Melbourne, Australia.
